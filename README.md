# What is the Weather Like?

#### This Python script visualize the weather of 500+ cities around the world of varying distance from the equator. 

## Part 1 - WeatherPy
#### Utilizing simple Python library and OpenWeatherMap API, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 

The first requirement is to create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

 - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
 - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
 - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
 - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
 - After each plot, add a sentence or two explaining what the code is analyzing.

The second requirement is to run linear regression on each relationship. This time, separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

 - Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
 - Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
 - Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
 - Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
 - Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
 - Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
 - Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
 - Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
 
 
After each pair of plots, I will describe any relationships and other analysis I find.

## Part 2 - VacationPy
### Next I will utilize my skills in working with weather data to plan future vacations using jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API to search for hotels within 5000 meters and plot markers on a heatmap by doing the following:
 - Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from Part I
 - Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition
    - A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.
    - Wind speed less than 10 mph.
    - Zero cloudiness.
    - Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. 
 - Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.
 - Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country.
